            <p class="paragtext">The word "basketball" comes from the English words "basket" (basket) and "ball" (ball). Basketball was invented and developed in the late 19th century in the USA. Initially, it was played using baskets set at a height where the players had to hit the ball. Thus, the word "basketball" directly refers to the main element of the game - throwing the ball into the basket.
                Basketball is a team game in which two teams compete by trying to throw the ball into the opponent's basket and defending their basket from enemy attacks. The main goals of the game are to throw the ball into the basket and score points, prevent the opponent from scoring and defend his basket.</p>
